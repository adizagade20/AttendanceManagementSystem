------------------------Attendance Management System------------------------------

â€¢ Steps to run (install) application
   As of my knowledge, all bugs are solved in current system (No new features).

1.	Configure your mysql server with username and password both being 'root'.
2	Next functions will be performed automatically (creating database and tables).
3.	For adding new teacher, there is username and password, put it as 'Admin' for both (You can't change it).
4.	Initially, you need to add atleast one teacher (if there are no teachers in the record).
5.	After adding teacher, program will check whether database is present or not, if not, it will create new one with 0 entries.
6.	Starting errors or exceptions are not handled till date (if rows are zero in table.)
7.	Now, we need to add some students from teacher login section to process them.
8.	If you delete any entry or student, you can't restore it by using the application.
9.	You have to open database in suitable application, and change column (IsDeleted) from 1 to 0.
10.	While exporting you need to provide number of lectures conducted till date so the application will be able to count the percentage.
